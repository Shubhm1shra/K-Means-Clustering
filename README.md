# K-Means-Clustering #
Implementation of K-Means-Clustering for Un-Supervised Data. 

## Logic ðŸ§  
The centroid knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't or where it isn't to where it is, which ever is minimum, it obtains a difference or deviation. The Guidance Sub-system uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the centroid from where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position where it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't.
